Java Coffee - Courtney Huang, Jason Yang, Yuki Feng
Lab03: Get Empirical

12/16/2021
* Courtney filled out the google form
* Yuki imported skeleton and updated notes.txt with class notes
* We discussed together how we want to conduct the experiment whoo!

12/17/2021
* updated README.md and plan.txt as a group

12/18/2021
* Yuki updated SearchDriver with test cases along with the timing variables, and
  performed the experiment on the integer arrays with both binary search and linear.
  She is confused why the first test case is always the longest and takes around
  65ms whereas the cases after take 0-1 ms.
* The Yukester also updated her GitHub user.email info so that she would show up
  as a contributor because the user.email got switched to her router...for some
  odd reason. She cheered and jumped for resolving the issue.
* Jason tried to run the code and wondered why everything was 1 ms
* Courtney also ran the code and tried to change the primitives to see if that may
  have been affecting the results. She failed to solve the problem. She will now be
  taking a break and come back to it later.

12/19/2021
* Yuki updated driver again by playing around with really large arrays. Ran into
  Java out of heap space error so she stuck to the original array sizes.

12/20/2021
* We are stuck, we are confused. We noticed that whatever we put first took the
  longest. We did something wrong with importing time?
* We posted a question to the QAF regarding our large time differences
* Courtney fixed the issue jfkdjfdk by increasing the size of the array and moving
  when it does System prints out the time before the binary search.
* Jason added 2 more test cases and updated readMe

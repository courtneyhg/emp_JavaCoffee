### Tests Performed
   1. 4 `Comparable` arrays of varying sizes (100, 10000, 1000000, 100000000) are created as the test cases.
   2. For each test case, the current time is recorded and assigned to a variable. Then, both `linearSearch` and `binarySearch` are used
   to find a target number in the array. After the number if found, the time is recorded again. 
   3. The before time is subtracted from the after time in order to find out the total time elapsed.

Lab 03: Get Empirical

- Utilize the BinSearch.java and LinSearch.java skeleton to perform either operation.
- In SearchDriver.java we create three different test cases with differing lengths of lists.
    - 100, 1000, 10000
- In the main of the SearchDriver.java file, we set a variable before running both methods to record the time difference in milliseconds.
  - LinSearch time record before running will be int linBefore
  - BinSearch time record before running will be int binBefore
- We then run each method for each test case, timing it using Date (System.time). We then subtract the recorded time from the first int before recording to find the difference.
